This was my second ever Python project, and my first trying to use csv’s. This was completed on 16/11/2021. The requirements for this project were:

1) Write a Python code to save the following list in a CSV file:
  
      ls = ["Hello", "Hi", "bye"]
      
2) Write a Python code to read the CSV file generated in the previous step to a Python list.

I wasn’t able to get the words to output as individual list items. Rather, all the words output as one item in a list of lists. I am hoping that in second year we will be taught how to utilise csv files properly, as any assignments with csv files in first year were to be done just on research and I struggle to get them to work in multiple projects.
